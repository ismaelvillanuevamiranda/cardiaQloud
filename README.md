This work proposes an ECG monitor and its implementation using three approaches: hardware, software, and cloud services. For the hardware approach, we used an e-Health platform for Arduino with three leads. The software and cloud-based approaches were implemented using the NodeJS framework to create the network communication between a local server and a remote server hosted on the Amazon Web Services infrastructure. Additionally, a responsive web application was developed to display the ECG signal, its R-R intervals, and the heart rate. Finally, an assessment was conducted to measure the quality of the ECG signal using Dynamic Time Warping.
